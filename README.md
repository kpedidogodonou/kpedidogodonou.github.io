# 👋 Hi, I'm Kpedido Godonou

Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree at **SRH University** with a strong focus on **Bioinformatics**, **Machine Learning**, and the application of AI in **Biological Sciences**.

I come from a multidisciplinary background — from Agronomy and Carpentry to Digital Entrepreneurship and AI toolmaking. After building platforms like [AXIGBE](https://axigbe.com) and launching several creative ventures, I’ve now shifted my energy toward scientific research and intelligent systems that advance biology and healthcare.

## 🧬 Current Interests

- **Bioinformatics & Computational Biology**  
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**  
- **Genomic Data Analysis & Data Engineering**  
- **AI Applications in Life Sciences**

## 🛠 Past Projects (Archived)

While my earlier projects are now archived, they laid the foundation for my current path. Highlights include:

- 🌍 **AXIGBE** – AI-powered local search engine for African services  
- 🎨 **Creative Brands** – Founder of Conxol Art Studio() & WOOHOUSE DESIGN

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

I'm now focused on research, collaborations, and open-source contributions at the intersection of biology and machine learning. If you’re working in a related field or just curious — let’s connect!
