Hi, I'm **Kpêdido**, a curious mind driven by the desire to build **impactful digital products**.

From **agribusiness** to **CNC woodworking**, and now to **tech and data**, my journey has been anything but linear. I taught myself how to code, developed intelligent tools for small businesses, and launched platforms like [**AXIGBE**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/axigbe/) to make local commerce smarter and more accessible in Benin.

Currently, I'm pursuing a **Master’s in Technology** at **SRH University Heidelberg in Germany**, where I’m deepening my skills in **Data Science, AI**, and recently find a strong interest in **Bioinformatics** an **Deep Learning applied to Live Sciences**.

I share my learning through comprehensive [**blog posts**](/year-archive/) and you can find about my projects [**here**](/portfolio/)
