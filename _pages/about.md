Hi, I'm Kpedido Godonou

I’m an aspiring Computational Biologist and data-driven builder exploring how AI and life sciences can come together to solve real problems.

My journey has taken me from agribusiness to data science, and now toward computational biology — a space where curiosity meets impact.

I’m currently based in Heidelberg, Germany, pursuing my studies and working on projects that combine machine learning, data analysis, and biological research. My goal is to build tools that make complex science more accessible and actionable.
